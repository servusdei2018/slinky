Design Document for CS142 Project 1: Web Browser Prototype

Goals
- Implement a file viewer that supports document navigation through anchors.
- Enable users to follow links between documents via commands.
- Maintain a history of visited files to allow backward navigation.
- Format text according to specified rules to enhance readability.

System Components

The project will be divided into the following key components: file handling module, anchor processing
module, navigation module, and formatting module. Each component will be responsible for a subset of
the overall functionality as follows:

1. File Handling Module
- Responsible for reading and parsing text files.
- Parses anchors, line breaks, and paragraph breaks.

2. Anchor Processing Module
- Detects anchors in the text and assigns unique numbers.
- Formats anchors for display as <text>[n].
- Handles special elements like <br> and <p> for appropriate spacing.

3. Navigation Module
- Manages file history for back command functionality.

4. Formatting Module
- Formats text output based on user-defined maximum line length.

User Interaction

1. Input Flow
- Prompt user for maximum line length.
- Display content of the current file with anchors formatted.
- Accept user commands (go, back, open) to navigate.

2. Output Flow
- Present formatted text in the console.
- Display anchor text with numbering for user selection.
